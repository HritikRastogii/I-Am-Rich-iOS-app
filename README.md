# iOSDevelopment

Started iOS Development using [Swift Programming Language](https://www.swift.org) and made some amazing applications.

Visit [App Icons](https://www.appicon.co) for generating app icons and images that fits all the resolutions.

Visit [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co) for amazing RGB and gradient colors.

# I Am Rich

It's just a UI based app with no functionality.

# Dicee

I have made a Las Vegas dice app. We can make the die roll at the press of a button or by shaking our phone. With this app in our pocket, weâ€™ll be fully set up to settle any score on the go!
